# Conscious Code â€“ Build Journal

Welcome to the public journal for the **LangChain v0.3+ Crash Course** â€” a 12-part YouTube series designed to help developers build real agentic apps using the latest LangChain tools.

Iâ€™m documenting everything here: what I publish, what I learn and how it evolves.

## ðŸ“… August 6, 2025 â€” Episode 1 Released!

**ðŸŽ¥ Video:** [LangChain v0.3: What Changed & Why You Should Upgrade](https://youtu.be/3L6W-C7Km7Y)  
**ðŸ“‚ Playlist:** [LangChain v0.3+ Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv5fXmCxvRd_X3DHTl68Pra5_oigfpmhv)  
**ðŸ’» Repo:** [GitHub â€“ ConsciousCode/langchain-v03-series](https://github.com/conscious-code-dev/LangChain-v0.3-Crash-Course-Build-Real-Agents-Deploy-Production-Ready-Apps)

**Core Focus:**
- Fixing breaking changes in LangChain v0.3
- Covering real developer pain points:
  - `.run()` â†’ `.invoke()`
  - LLMChain deprecation
  - `initialize_agent()` removal
  - Pydantic v2 migration
  - Memory import issues
  - Structured output errors

**Learning Activity:**
- Learnt Basic Video Editing in Da Vinci Resolve within 2 days
- Strengthened LangChain basics (obviously!)

**Reflection:**
> Took a lot of effort to get everything out for Ep 1. I'm still learning LangChain, editing video, writing code, and building my presence. No gear, no budget â€” just clarity and persistence. Now that the foundation is in place, Iâ€™ll shift more energy to recording Ep 2.

## ðŸ“… August 8, 2025 â€” Episode 2 Recorded

**ðŸŽ¥ Video:** [Quickstart Project (Poetry Setup)	Scaffold a clean LangChain project using Poetry](https://youtu.be/JVyqGwFL31k)  
**ðŸ“‚ Playlist:** [LangChain v0.3+ Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv5fXmCxvRd_X3DHTl68Pra5_oigfpmhv)  
**ðŸ’» Repo:** [GitHub â€“ ConsciousCode/contract_simplifier](https://github.com/conscious-code-dev/contract_simplifier)

**Core Focus:**
- Scaffolding a modern Python project using **Poetry**
- Setting up a clean `src/` layout for production
- Building and testing a **FastAPI app** with LangChain integration
- Validating inputs with **Pydantic + FastAPI**
- Writing automated tests with `pytest` for the `/simplify` endpoint
- Deploying to the cloud with **Render** using `render.yaml`
- Solving real-world issues (ðŸ’€ *greenlet + Python 3.12 drama*)

**Learning Activity:**
- Navigated Python packaging + Poetry quirks
- Learned deployment flow via **Render** without Docker
- Built confidence handling native dependency errors (greenlet, wheels, etc.)
- Practiced recording + teaching while debugging real-time

**Reflection:**
> This one flowed better. Less second-guessing, more execution. 
>
> The project is now cloud-deployed, tested, and ready for LLM logic. The dev setup is **legit**, not just a notebook hack.
>
> Video editing still eats time, but Iâ€™m getting faster. Every episode now builds momentum â€” next up: chaining prompts and streaming output.
